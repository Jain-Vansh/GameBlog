                    The franchise's first game, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, was released in 2007, and followed by the sequels Uncharted 2: Among Thieves (2009), Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception (2011), and Uncharted 4: A Thief's End (2016). Spin-offs Uncharted: Golden Abyss (2011), Uncharted: Fight for Fortune (2012), and the standalone expansion Uncharted: The Lost Legacy (2017) also support the main series.

                    The main games are played from a third-person perspective, with gameplay mostly revolving around combat, shooting, exploration, and puzzles, while platforming is used to navigate the environment. Later titles began including competitive and co-operative multiplayer game modes, stealth, and driving gameplay. Uncharted drew inspiration from other games,[1] film, and additional media, and is known for featuring exotic locations. Several adaptations of the series have also been released, including a live-action film, board games, comics, and a novel.

                    Nathan "Nate" Drake (born Nathan Morgan in 1976) is the main protagonist of the Uncharted franchise, serving as the main protagonist of all four main installments, Uncharted: Golden Abyss and Uncharted: Eye of Indra, and a mentioned character in Uncharted: The Lost Legacy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He is an American treasure hunter, fortune seeker, and action pro who became obsessed with the famous English explorer Sir Francis Drake at a young age, to the point of adopting his last name as his new one. During his adventures, Nate fights against other power hungry individuals while also evading death at every corner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nathan possesses the "every-man" persona; Nate has a dry humor, is quick to help others, but can also be temperamental and indifferent to violence and death. He is focused mainly on his work but will help others of their lives are at risk. He has demonstrated the abilities to read Latin and Spanish. Aside from being quirky at times, Nate can be surprisingly tactical. He will scan an environment and use stealth if the odds are stacked against him before charging headfirst into a gunfight. A prime example is when Zoran Lazarević augmented himself with sap from the Tree of Life. As he became too powerful to attack head-on, Nate used the sap around the area, which was explosive, to wound him and bring him back to his mortal state.

                    Samuel "Sam" Drake (born Samuel Morgan) is a major character in the Uncharted franchise. He is the deuteragonist and a minor playable character in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, and the tritagonist of Uncharted: The Lost Legacy.
                    He is a professional thief and treasure hunter, as well as the older brother of Nathan Drake. Initially thought to have died during a prison break, fifteen years prior to the events of the game and even before the events of the other games in the series, he returns in order to seek Nate's help in finding the lost treasure of Henry Avery.
                    Sam is voiced and motion-captured by Troy Baker, though he was originally going to be voiced by Todd Stashwick.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sam shares his brother's penchant for sarcasm, and his sense of humor. When they search for their mother's journals in Evelyn's presumed empty home, he says he's "always been the funny one" after cracking a joke. He is more reckless than Nate, however, and slightly jealous of his brother's achievements. In Uncharted: The Lost Legacy he is more calm, even somewhat absent-minded, and has little interest in the adventure of the game, it will be that finding the treasure of Avery has overcome part of his greed towards history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Much like Nate, he is a competent marksman, climber, and brawler. It is possible that he trained his brother in fighting and brawling as hinted through dialogue when fighting Gustavo and fellow prisoners in the Panamanian jail, as well as in free-running and climbing. Due to spending most of his imprisoned life exercising, he is in excellent physical condition.

                    Victor "Sully" Sullivan is one of the two deuteragonists (alongside Elena Fisher) of the Uncharted video game series, serving as the tritagonist of Uncharted: Drake's Fortune and Uncharted: Golden Abyss, a supporting character in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, the deuteragonist of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception and one of the two tritagonists of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. He is an American treasure hunter as well as an old friend and mentor at one point of Nathan Drake, who considers him family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Victor "Sully" Sullivan was born in 1950 to unnamed father, whom the former described as being lousy during his childhood. When he reached the appropriate age, Sully joined the United States Navy, but he was later dishonorably discharged when he was caught running illegal scams. Following his discharge, Sully became a free lance thief and encountered Katherine Marlowe, whom he began a romantic relationship with. Around this time, Victor pulled off a fake santo on Pablo Escobar, and later encountered the drug baron Hector Alcázar when in Japan. In addition, Sully had a run in with Shoreline's leader Nadine Ross, but he was able to get the upper hand when he evaded them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the most part, Sully is a kind man who cares deeply for Nate, the man he raised as his own son. The pair constantly mock one another, albeit lightheartedly. Like Nate, is very quick to make jokes, sometimes even expanding on Nate's, even when the pair are in somewhat dire situations, such as when they had been captured by Flynn and Lazarević's men in Borneo. He always advises Nate to take more prudent action instead of thinking with his pride. He is very protective of those he is fond of, constantly risking his life for his friends.

                    Elena Fisher is one of the two deuteragonists (alongside Victor Sullivan) of the Uncharted video game series, serving as a minor character in the comic Uncharted: Eye of Indra, the deuteragonist of Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, the tritagonist of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, a supporting character in Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception and one of the two tritagonists (alongside Sullivan) of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End.Elena is an American former journalist, TV personality, and foreign correspondent who appears in every console game in the franchise. Amy Hennig commented that she created Elena to be the "female version of Drake" instead of the "damsel in distress" type. By A Theif's End, she is married to Nate, with whom she has a daughter named Cassie.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Elena is the "female version of Drake" as creator Amy Hennig describes; she is just as charming, intelligent and tenacious as him, and can hold her own when climbing or under fire.
                    This is pointed out by Nate himself in Drake's Fortune as he is impressed by her ability during the attack on their boat. The two have the same sense of humor and cavalier attitude toward their opponents, but she tends to be more naïve and compassionate (such as when Harry Flynn is dying).
                    Elena is optimistic and cunning, driving Nate to keep moving forward. She doesn't always agree with Nate's decisions but helps him anyway. She becomes a much better strategist over the course of the games. She helps Nate plan ways into sneaking into restricted areas and taking out opponents.
